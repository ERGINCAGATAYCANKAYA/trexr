# trexr <img src="inst/app/www/hex-trexr.png" width=130 height = 150 align="right" />

The goal of trexr is to explore trees in R visually and graphically. This package is _less_ research based and more application based. Thus, if you are looking for more details on LiDAR and tree segmentation please see [weblidar-treetop](https://github.com/carlos-alberto-silva/weblidar-treetop) excellent app (a lot of the inspiration for this app was from [weblidar-treetop](https://github.com/carlos-alberto-silva/weblidar-treetop)). This package allows the user to do explore canopy height models (CHM) through graphs (histograms, density, boxplot), map (leaflet), 3-d and stats. The main feature is the ability to crop your input (AOI) and generate new information. In addition, users can convert from meters to feet (vice-versa) or change height (filter) CHM on the fly. 

## Installation
